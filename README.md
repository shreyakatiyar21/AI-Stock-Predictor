# Stock Predictor using LSTM

This project uses historical stock price data and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict future stock prices. The model is trained on past stock data and can predict the next day's closing price based on the historical trends.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- `yfinance` - For downloading stock data.
- `numpy` - For numerical operations.
- `pandas` - For handling data.
- `sklearn` - For scaling the data.
- `tensorflow` - For building and training the LSTM model.
- `matplotlib` - For visualizing the predictions.

You can install all dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
